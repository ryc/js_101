// a function that returns the sum of two numbers
>> Casual Pseudocode
Given 2 numbers, n1 and n2.

Add the 2 numbers and return the result

>> Formal Pseducode
START

# Given 2 numbers n1 and n2:

Return the result of (n1 + n2)

// a function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

>> Casual
Given an array of strings.

Iterate through the collection one by one.
  - save the first value as the starting value
  - for each iteration, append the current value to the saved value

After iterating through the collection, return the saved value.

>> Formal
START
# Given an array of strings.

SET iterator = 1
SET result = first value in the array

WHILE iterator <= length of the given array
  SET currentValue = value within the array at space "iterator"
  result = result + currentValue

  iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT result

END

// a function that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

>> Casual
Given an array of integers.

While iterating through the given array
- check if the iterator is even
  - if yes, save the currentValue to a new array
  - otherwise, do nothing

After iterating through the collection, return the new array

>> Formal
START

# Given an array of integers.

SET iterator = 0

  SET currentValue = the element at the iterator position
  IF iterator is even
    add the currentValue to the result array
  ELSE
    skip to the next iteration

  iterator = iterator + 1
  
PRINT result
